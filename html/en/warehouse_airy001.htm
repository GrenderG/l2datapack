Warehouse Keeper Airy<br>Welcome! Have you come to entrust your possessions? Or do you have other business? I am very tired now, so get to the point. Oh! You don't need to pay when you entrust your items. You can pay when you pick them up. Don't carry all this like a fool, just entrust it to our guild. I'll keep it safe...<br><a action="bypass -h deposit">Deposit Item (Private Warehouse)</a><br><a action="bypass -h withdraw">Withdraw Item (Private Warehouse)</a><br><br><a action="bypass -h deposit_pledge">Deposit Item (Clan Warehouse)</a><br><a action="bypass -h withdraw_pledge">Withdraw Item (Clan Warehouse)</a><br><br><a action="bypass -h learn_skill">Learn Skills</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
