High Priest Orven:<br>You've worked really hard... It will be great if we can use this to appease the resentment of those that suffered due to the evil actions of our ancestors...<br>I hereby grant you the mark of watcher that you are seeking. Even if you end up dead in your meeting with Antharas, at least you'll go to the next world having cleansed the sin of the evil that was passed on from the ancestors. May the guidance of light be with you...</body></html>
