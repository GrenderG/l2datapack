Mercenary Red Foot:

Hush!  Come closer to me.  I’ll give you some information of great worth.  I overheard traders talking among themselves.  Some time ago, the cargo wagon of the Aden Business Association that was traveling from Giran to Dion had been robbed and an item of great value was stolen.  It is a gem called the Imperial Diamond and it is a priceless gem.  Well, since it was a gemstone that used to decorate a king’s crown, it wouldn’t be an ordinary item… now would it?  I wish I could have the opportunity to look at it even once in my life time…
