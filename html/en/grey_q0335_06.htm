Hunter Guild Member Grey:<br>Ho, ho... You found the items from the test list! You appeared to be a beginner, but I guess I'd better take another look at you! OK, this is certainly enough for you to obtain qualification as a hunter. I hereby bestow on you the 1-circle hunter license. And congratulations on joining the guild. You are a new hunting brother!<br>Now you also can take on and perform the various requests that come to the Hunter Guild. Please go ask <font color="LEVEL">Hunter Guild Member Tor</font> over there for details.<br>Sometimes you'll take on hunting jobs that come in to the guild in a formal way; other times you'll be hired by individuals. Recently <font color="LEVEL">Magic General Shopkeeper Cybellin</font> asked me to introduce him to a trustworthy hunter; would you like to go meet him?</body></html>
