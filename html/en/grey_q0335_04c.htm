Hunter Guild Member Grey:<br>This is the task to kill the three Haka brothers whose evil names are well-known and bring their heads. These three brothers named <font color="LEVEL">Haka, Jakja and Marka</font> are prefects of the breka orc tribe. They are very evil ones that attack the carriages of the merchants, set fire to the houses of the people and massacre the citizens so that there is a bounty set by the lord of Giran on their heads.<br>Perhaps it's because they heard about the bounty on their heads that they have not been seen so much recently. But with the <font color="LEVEL">breka orc warriors</font> having been killed, they are sure to show up to carry out their tribal revenge.<br><a action="link grey_q0335_04.htm">Go back.</a></body></html>
