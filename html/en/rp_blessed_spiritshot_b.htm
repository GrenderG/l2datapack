The Blessed Spiritshot - B Grade is used in conjunction with another B Grade weapon.  It is a support type magic item that greatly increases a weapon's M. Atk.
<br>
Also, this item is even more useful due to the fact that it has the effect of increasing one’s magic casting speed.

Since many wizards use the spiritshot to cast more powerful magic, the manufacture of a spiritshot will be of great benefit to Dwarves.
