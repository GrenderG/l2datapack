All right, let’s go ahead and open this box…  Opening a padlock like this one is a piece of cake…  Here we go!  There… that was too easy.  Now, let’s see what’s in the box.

What’s this…?  It’s Spidersilk Rope!  It’s a very strong and light rope that is made from the spidersilk that is collected from the Tarantula Spider’s webs in the Spine Mountain Range.  If you take it to a store, I’m sure you should be able to get a really good price for it.
