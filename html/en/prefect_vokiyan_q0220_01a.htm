Prefect Vokiyan:
<br>
Do you know! Seers are all saying that the eternal winter is approaching! It won't be long...  We must prepare for the days of chaos and destruction, and the distressed days of endless wars and disasters. You must strengthen your power as well! Before anything else, you should complete your occupation change! If you want to fight against the darkness that the era of chaos brings along, you must first exceed your level as a beginner!
<br>
(Quest only for Elven characters who have completed occupation change and are more than level 37.)
