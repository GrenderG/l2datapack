Master Langut:
<br>
Now you are ready to begin honing your skills in direct combat. Try hunting the <font color="LEVEL">keltirs</font> that run loose in the fields northwest of Cedric's Training Hall. And retrieve <font color="LEVEL">four keltir fangs,</font> a quest item found on dead keltirs. Do this, and I will reward you.
<br>
You may find the keltirs' at the place indicated by the yellow dot on the radar, at the upper-right corner of the screen.
