Sorcerer Kaiena:<br>You did a great job. With strength like that, you may even have a 1% chance of success! Even if you can't kill Antharas... If you keep bothering him, at least it will be possible to delay his complete awakening. I want to tell you to run away quickly if it's dangerous but the Lair of Antharas is such a place that once you enter you cannot leave... Anyway, here is my mark of watcher that I give to you. If any of your colleagues have not yet gotten a mark of watcher after killing marsh stalkers and marsh drakes, please go help them do that. </body></html>
