Hunters Guild Member Tor:
<br>
I appreciate your hard work!  Here is your reward.  Also, you will receive this laurel leaf pin.  This is a sort of medal that is awarded to a hunter whenever he successfully completes a hunting request.  The more pins you possess, the higher chance you will have to be assigned to class B and class A requests.
<br>
Now then, would you like to receive a new request?
<br>
<a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=335&reply=3">Tell him that you would like to receive a new request to work on.</a>
<br>
<a action="link tor_q0335_09.htm">Tell him that you would like to take a break.</a>
