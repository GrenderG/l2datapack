Go to the entrance to Dragon Valley and meet Land Dragon Watcher Gilmore. Don't be surprised by his wicked appearance. He was one of the 17 guardians that participated in the sealing of Antharas. He chose to become an undead in order to faithfully carry out his role. He will teach you how to enter the Lair of Antharas.
