Warehouse Chief Klump:
<br>
Itâ€™s nice to meet you.  My name is Klump, the warehouse chief of Iron Gate Guild.  I look forward to working with you. Although Giran is the center of commodities trading, the volume of goods that flow through Aden Castle Town is not very far behind.  The main difference is that rather than the necessities of life, here, a higher proportion of goods being traded are luxury items such as decorating materials, art works etc.
