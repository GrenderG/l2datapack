Fast learners of your level will already be using a <font color="LEVEL">long sword</font> or a <font color="LEVEL">cestus</font>. Even if you haven't had much luck hunting, you should be able to earn enough soon to buy these weapons.
<br>
For bow users, the Bow of Forest may be too much of a burden if it's just a supplemental weapon. A <font color="LEVEL">Hunting Bow</font> would be adequate.
<br>
Regarding armor, start with a <font color="LEVEL">bone breastplate, and bone gaiters</font>, along with a buckler, gloves, leather shoes and a wooden helmet make an effective combination when you're around level 17. If you are diligent in watching the market between adventurers, you may be able to find even better gear for an equivalent price.
