Warehouse Keeper Sorint:
<br>
I keep anyones property. Even if a unicorn walks in on two feet and asks me to keep his horn I will gladly show him the account books. However, I cannot teach skills that easily just by getting paid.
<br>
...If I teach anyone, we Dwarven Artisans will not have anything to do! We can learn from the foolish Elves, who taught the Humans magic, only to get backstabbed.
