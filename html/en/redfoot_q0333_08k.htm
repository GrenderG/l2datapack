Mercenary Red Foot:
<br>
I will give you some information that will be useful to someone who travels a lot like yourself.  According to the law of the land, the traders of this kingdom are not allowed to deal with criminals.  But there are some traders who ignore this rule and sell their items to outlaws.  These people include, Grocer Pano of Floran Village and Twyla who has set up her trade in the western section of the Dark Forest.  Although they are business people, I think it’s shameless of them to deal with criminals… just to make money.
