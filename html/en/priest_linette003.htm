Priest Linette:<br>I'm sorry but my words will be nothing more to you than empty, flowery, long-winded, boring stories. Hmm... Well, there aren't many people that say this so harshly but anyway, even if you listen to what I have to say, it won't help you much at all. It would be better for you to go find someone of the warrior guild or the guild of another race.</body></html>
