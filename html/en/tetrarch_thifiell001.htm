Tetrarch Thifiell:
<br>
May the mercy of Shilen be with you.
<br>
I am chosen by Gran Kain, the Father of Shadow, and Shilen, the Mother of Abyss. On behalf of the Patriarch, who was sealed away by those who were servants to the light, I represent the senior council that governs the race of darkness. I am Tetrarch Thifiell, who released his brothers from the underground place of exile and recaptured the shadow forest from the Elves. Son of Shilen, what do you want to know?
