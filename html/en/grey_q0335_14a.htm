Hunter Guild Member Grey:
<br>
Dozens of hunting requests come in to the Hunter Guild every day. Why don't you go to <font color="LEVEL">Hunter Guild Member Tor</font> to find out what requests have currently come in? If there is a project that you like, you can take and carry it out.
<br>
Or there are also cases where hunters are hired by individuals, rather than through formal orders to the guild. Recently <font color="LEVEL">Magic General Shopkeeper Cybellin</font> asked me to introduce him to a trustworthy hunter; would you like to go meet him?
