Pet Manager Joey:
<br>
I said I was going to buy the pet kennel but my wife and the kids all opposed that. Ah, they were saying that in today's world, nobody would pay money to raise pets. Instead of spending that kind of money, they would rather pick up a sword and kill monsters. But, hey... That's what those people think! The crazier the world is, the more people thirst after gentle love!
