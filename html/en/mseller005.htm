If you contract with me, I'll give you certificates showing that you've hired us mercenaries and then you just put them in the places that you want to deploy the mercenaries to. When the battle starts, we mercenaries will fight with all our might to protect the life of you, our lord!<br>If you're not happy with a placement, just pick up the certificate again and move it to the location that you want.<br> There is a limit to the number of mercenaries that you can hire and so even if you purchase more certificates than that, please keep in mind that it won't be possible for mercenaries in excess of that limit to participate in the battle.  <BR>Also, you can't place the mercenaries too close together and the mercenaries can only be deployed inside the castle. Of course, if you place contract certificates of other castles here, those mercenaries won't come to help. <br> Also, you should know that the contract with us finishes after a single siege.<br>
