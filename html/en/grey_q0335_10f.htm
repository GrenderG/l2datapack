Hunter Guild Member Grey:
<br>
This is the task of bringing back five heads of talk bugbear raiders on whom the Aden Commercial Guild has put a bounty. The name of their leader is Kalath and his underlings are Athu, Triska, Motura and Lanka. They are evil ones that lead the <font color="LEVEL">talk bugbear warriors</font> to attack the merchants' carriages and steal their cargo. Well, even if this weren't a test task, you should still step out and deal with them, right?
