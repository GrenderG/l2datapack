Ho... Are you going off the handle because I called you a beginner? Or are you really planning to try for the hunter license? If so, listen carefully to my explanation. There are two levels of hunter. Most hunters are 1-circle but those with excellent abilities can obtain the 2-circle license by completing a test. You'll need to take the <font color="LEVEL">1-circle license test</font> first, of course.
<br>
To pass the license test, you have to bring back at least three of the items on the test list.
