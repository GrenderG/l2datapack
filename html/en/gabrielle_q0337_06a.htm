Gabrielle:
<br>
There were a total of seventeen guardians that participated in the sealing of Antharas. Seven were Human, three were Elven beauties, five were Dwarven Artisans and two were Orcish soldiers. The Dwarves formed the Gray Column Guild and taught generation after generation of guild members how to guard the "column" that holds up the aura. The three Elven sisters Shyslassys, Gorr and Baraham swallowed runestones containing the power of the aura and chose the fate of becoming evil beings themselves. And three of the seven Human warriors sold their souls to Dasparion to take on the bodies of those that can never die and became the "watchmen of the land dragon." The other four Humans chose to pass on the role of watching Antharas to their children. And one of them was me.
