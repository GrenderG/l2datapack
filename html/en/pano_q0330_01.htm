Grocer Pano:<br>Dionian potatoes? Yesâ€¦ People say they are the best potatoes in the kingdom, raised in our own province. They are not only big but also sweet. <br>However, recently <font color="LEVEL">hobgoblin plunderers</font> are interfering with our potato production. The farmers are experiencing severe damage. Those hobgoblin rascals steal flock, tear up the fields, and take all our crop... If this goes on, it will be difficult to properly harvest any crop this year, let alone potatoes. Since wares are not coming in, it is harder for me to keep up my trade.<br>The village chief seems to be hiring some soldiers to try to keep out the thieves... But it is not as easy as people thought it would be. It would be nice if you went out and got rid of the hobgoblins. If you take care of the task, I will give you some Dionian potatoes that I have in stock.<br>I will keep my promise, so don't worry. Here, I have written a contract, so keep it safe with you. Remember the conditions of the contract. If you kill the hobgoblins and bring back <font color="LEVEL">thirty tokens</font> as proof, I will give you a sack of Dionian potatoes.</body></html>
