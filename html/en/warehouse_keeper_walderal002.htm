Warehouse Keeper Walderal:

Hmm, then sign on the paper…  Oh no!  you shouldn’t sign a paper without first reviewing its contents.  You are lucky that I am a honest dwarf.  Although I hate to tell you this but, do you know how many dwarf swindlers are out there?  Please be careful from now on.  Ah, anyway, your item has been processed.
