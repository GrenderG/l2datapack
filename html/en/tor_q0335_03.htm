Hunters Guild Member Tor:<br>Oh I see!  You are now taking on the challenge of obtaining a hunter license 2.  That’s great!  A person of your caliber should be well qualified to become a circle 2 hunter!<br>하지만 <font color="LEVEL">However, according to our policy, those who are currently taking the test to obtain a hunter’s license cannot accept a request.  </font>So, try to pass the test quickly and come back to take on new requests! </body></html>
