The particularly vicious and strong of the black boars that lives in the Giran region is called <font color="LEVEL">windsus aleph</font>. This is the task of bringing its skin. You can't find it by just stubbornly going around in Giran. If you go through the <font color="LEVEL">Death Pass</font> region and hunt windsuses one after the other, this creature will appear. If it shows its face while you're paying attention, just let an arrow fly without delay!
