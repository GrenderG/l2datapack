Magister Mirien:
<br>
The 'searcher' is a term used to call all high level Magicians of the Ivory Tower. In the first place, they are the ones who are supposed to search wisdom and thereby try to understand the nature of the world, those who try to make order in this chaotic world by applying the wisdom that he acquired through research, and finally, those who are willing to pass on the knowledge and experience to the young.
<br>
The searcher is qualified to pass on the highest magic. And the very test for examining the qualifications is the <font color="LEVEL">Test of the Searcher</font>.
<br>
If you wish to acquire knowledge on a higher basis, you can't escape the trial, but for the time I think it is way too early. As the great Magician Akenias said, knowledge is something that you 'win'. If you think that your will is strong enough, do not hesitate to challenge the trial.
