Hunter Guild Member Grey: This is the task of gathering <br><font color="LEVEL">30 sea of spores seeds</font>. For your reference, you can get sea of spores seeds by going to the Sea of Spores and killing the <font color="LEVEL">giant fungus</font>.<br>Normally, I'm not supposed to be giving you any hints. That's because you need to get the information yourself. Of course, I'm just an old softie... You should be thankful for my special help this time only!<br><a action="link grey_q0335_04.htm">Go back.</a></body></html>
