Priest Ross:<br>Einhasad's scriptures of light welcome you. You may stay here as long as you wish. But I don't think I can be of much help to you who seeks after the truth. That's because I'm still inexperienced and the brilliance of Einhasad can only be given to Human priests and priestesses that have already heard the message of the gods.</body></html>
