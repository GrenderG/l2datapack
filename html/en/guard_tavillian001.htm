Guard Tavillian:<br>Greetings! Welcome to the Ivory Tower!<br>Hmm... Traveler, did you cross the northern border? What's it like there? One of my friends who works at the checkpoint said the area is in a state of emergency. He can't even go out freely...<br>I'm worried that something bad will happen so soon after our war with Elmore. My little sister is lives in that region... Damn it! I wish she wasn't so far away!<br><a action="link guard_tavillian002.htm">Can you tell me about how the tower is structured?</a><br><a action="link guard_tavillian002.htm">Nothing much will happen.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
