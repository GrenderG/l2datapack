Warehouse Chief Moke:
<br>
Thanks to your hard work, we were able to destroy the two abyss jewels and to defend the column maintaining the magic force field.  On behalf of the brothers of Grey Column, I would like to express our gratitude to you.  Now, take the mark of watchers you received from me and Halton and go back to <font color="LEVEL">Gabrielle</font>.
