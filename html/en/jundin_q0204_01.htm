Patriarch Mitraell:
<br>
Young one, I have great expectations for you. Take my blood into the Dark Elven Village and find <font color="LEVEL">Guide Frankle</font> there. He will advise you as you train.
<br>
It will be easy to find him, for he is marked with a yellow dot on your radar. The village is southwest from the temple, inside the great mountain. <font color="LEVEL">Follow the yellow dot, and look for the village entrance to your left as you reach the mountains.</font>
