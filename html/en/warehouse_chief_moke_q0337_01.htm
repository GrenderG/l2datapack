Warehouse Chief Moke:<br>Is this a feather of gabrielle?  Well then let me introduce myself to you again.  My name is Moke, seal watcher.  Although I am currently working as a warehouse keeper to guard the Bronze Gate, I have been trained in the Grey Column Guild to become a watcher.   From generation to generation, we dwarves have instilled the power of a seal to restrain the evil spirits of Shilen to architectural objects called “Columns.”  As long as a column is standing firmly on the ground, evil spirits will not be released due to the power of the seal.<br>However, currently one of the columns that contain the power of a magic force field to restrain Antharas is being threatened.  The followers of Antharas are attempting to weaken the power of the column by using an abyss jewel.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=337&reply=1">Ask about abyss jewel.</a></body></html>
