Master Ghest:<br>You could never realize the truths of battle that I have already told you about. That's because your are someone that is still surrounded by a shell and looks away from brutal truths.<br>I couldn't care less whether you agree with me on this or not. Didn't I already tell you? Battle is performed only to enforce what one believes... I have just defeated you.</body></html>
