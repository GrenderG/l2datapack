Gatekeeper Elisabeth:
<br>
I am Gatekeeper Elisabeth who is one of the managers of the Gate of Space and Time that was sent from the Ivory Tower. This Aden Castle is very well-known as the center of politics, culture and religion but I still haven't had a chance to look around properly because I've been so busy... Even though I'm a gatekeeper that can send people instantaneously to other far-away villages... It's kind of ridiculous.
