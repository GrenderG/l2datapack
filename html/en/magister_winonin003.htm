Sorcerer Winonin:<br>Are you making fun of me too!? There is no reason that I'd be able to teach magic to the likes of you that are not even an Elven mage..! Teach me magic? Is it OK for you to entrust magic to me? I'm asking you! Really, really...!<br>If one person just goes around like a drunkard with nobody to listen to him talk about magic, he just mutters on and on every day about this and that saying to go conquer the world..<br>Boo, hoo! Oh, my hometown... Please send me back to the foot of the beautiful Mother Tree...!</body></html>
