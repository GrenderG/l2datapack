Warehouse Chief Moke:
<br>
Oh, you brought back a fragment of abyss jewel and a jewel guardian’s fang.  You did a great job.  I will send this fragment to Elder Filaur so that he can melt it away completely in the “blast furnace of supremacy”.  This is to prevent the magic force field that is stopping Antharas from ever being threatened again.  I appreciate your hard work.  Thanks to you the column that is maintaining the magic force field is safe now.  I will give you a <font color="LEVEL">mark of watchers</font>. You have sufficiently proven yourself to be worthy of receiving this mark.
