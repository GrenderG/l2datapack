Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>Have you changed your mind?  Heh heh, good good…  It is a good thing to admit your foolishness honestly.  I don’t know what you were thinking when you did not want to hand over to me the scepter.  Anyhow, you must realize that you don’t have the power to defend it.  It will end up in my hands sooner or later.  Well now, give it to me.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=503&reply=8">"I refuse."</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=503&reply=9">"I agree to trade it with you."</a></body></html>
