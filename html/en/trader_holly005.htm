Trader Holly:<br>Hee hee hee…  Don’t joke around with me!  Huh?  Did you happen to be hit by a pickpocket?  You should really be careful.  Didn’t you know?  This place, the town of Aden has many rich people walking around the streets.  We have many pickpockets who prey on them.  Even when you see elves or dwarves, never let your guard down.  You don’t find many pickpockets among orcs…  They have more inclined to be robbers… perhaps?  Ah, I was joking.  Actually, orcs don’t have many pickpockets among them because they value dignity and honor greatly.  It is not like an orc to sneak around and steal things..<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=0">Buy</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=8">Sell</a></body></html>
