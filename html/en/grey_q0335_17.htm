Oh, that is too bad. There just aren't many youngsters like yourself around these days... But if you are dreaming of something else, then I won't stop you... May your wishes come true... You've received payment of a small bonus for your work for the guild. Please use it for travel expenses. OK, well, this is goodbye. May the divine protection of the gods be with you...
