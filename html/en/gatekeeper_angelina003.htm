Gatekeeper Angelina:<br>Oh...? I've seen you before... when searching for a criminal. You're definitely someone that committed a crime like murder and is being chased around? Regardless of the situation, us gatekeepers cannot open the Gate to Space and Time for you. That would mean we were helping in the flight of a fugitive.. How about it? Fortunately, this is a harbor. You could try to stowaway or something...?</body></html>
