Blacksmith Helton:
<br>
A simple explanation of an abyss jewel is that it is a device that aborbs the nearby magic of darkness. They seem to be using that power to destroy the aura that binds Antharas. We can't rest for the timebeing because if the aura is destroyed like that, Antharas who has gotten more than enough sleep will stretch himself out. Do you know what I'm talking about? We've got to destroy the abyss jewel!
<br>
According to the information I've heard, the abyss jewel seems to be in the <font color="LEVEL">southern border region of the Sea of Spores.</font> However, the protective spirits of darkness are watching over it. They have the power not only to keep away those who would destroy the abyss jewel but they can also raise it up again from the small fragments if it were to be destroyed. Therefore, while destroying the abyss jewel, you must obliterate every last one of those spirits of darkness. Get the <font color="LEVEL">fragments of the jewel</font> and if you bring me the <font color="LEVEL">proof of having killed the jewel guardians</font> and the jewel fragments, I'll give you proof of guardian.
