Have you ever seen an item called a <font color="LEVEL">Magicshot</font> while hunting? Or have you ever wondered about what a Magicshot is while reading the detailed information about a weapon?
<br>
A Magicshot is an item that increases your magic attack. Directions for usage are identical to Soulshots. While Soulshots increase physical damage, Magicshots increase magic attack powers.
<br>
When using Magicshots, your spellcasting speed increases, as well as the damage and the success rate of debuff type magic. It is quite a useful item.
<br>
You will be able to acquire Magicshot-using weapons when you reach level 15. Check the information when buying a weapon. If the Magicshot consumption is more than x1, it means that the weapon uses as many Magicshots as indicated.
