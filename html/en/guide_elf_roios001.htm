<html><head><body>Greetings! I am Roios, and it is my task to educate novice Elves.<br>Elven lives are long by the standards of other folk, so the choices an Elf makes in youth will bear fruit for many years to come. I teach the novices until it is time for them to leave this their home. If you require advice, please feel welcome to ask me.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-7&reply=1">Ask for advice.</a></body></html>
