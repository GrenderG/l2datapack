Prefect Chakris:<br>Angel feather?! This means you are the one sent by Gabrielle! You're out to fight with the land dragon, right? That's incredible bravery you have! But let's see if you've got abilities to go with that bravery! Go to <font color="LEVEL">Giant Cave</font> right now, kill <font color="LEVEL">kranrot and hamrut</font> and bring me the evidence! If you can't do this successfully, then you'll be blown away just by the breath of Antharas, let alone be able to kill the monster!</body></html>
