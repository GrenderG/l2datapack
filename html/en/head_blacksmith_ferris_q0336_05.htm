Head Blacksmith Ferris:

Oh, you mean the bereth's blood dragon? I can exchange a bereth's blood dragon for 10 blood basilisks, 10 silver dryads and 20 gold knights... Huh? Ah... Or would you rather play a game? That would be fine with me... I'm really strong at this game. We can exchange at a somewhat better ratio through this game that is popular at the collector's club.
