Earthdragon Watcher Gilmore:
<br>
...<font color="LEVEL">Gabrielle</font> is the head of the seal watcher...
<br>
She can be located in <font color="LEVEL">Giran Castle Town</font>. If you truly intend to face Antharas, go meet with Gabrielle and then meet with the other seal watchers to collect the marks of watchers from them.
<br>
… However you should bear this in mind.  … Your decision to face Antharas is the expression of your resolve to bring him death…  Since Antharas knows this, he will mercilessly attack anyone who stands in front of him.
<br>
Once you are approved by the watchers, Gabrielle will give you the <font color="LEVEL">herald of slayer</font>. Bring it back to me…
