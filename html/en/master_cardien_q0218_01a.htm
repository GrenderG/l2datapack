Master Cardien:<br>Soon we will face a great difficulty which is a matter of life and death to our tribe. For this reason the Hierarch Asterios is calling for all young Elves to gather in the Elven Forest. Therefore you must soon go back to your homeland, but before that it is necessary that you change your occupation and get over the position as a beginner.<br>(Quest only for Elven characters who is above level 37 and have completed their 1st occupation change.)</body></html>
