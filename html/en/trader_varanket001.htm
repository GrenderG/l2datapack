Trader Varan:
<br>
Welcome to the general store, run by the famous brother and sister team. You won’t be disappointed, take a look. Our shop makes items in cooperation with the Ivory Tower, famous for magic, as well as the Dwarven guild ‘Breath of Flame.' Actually, my sibling is a bit of a chatterbox… it is a good thing you’ve come to me.
