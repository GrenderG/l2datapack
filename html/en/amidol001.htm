Warehouse Freightman Aldo:<br>It looks like you’re about to head out on a journey. You’re not actually going to take all that stuff with you, are you? Listen, let me give you a piece of advice... Take only what is absolutely necessary. The rest you can leave with me, Aldo. The Iron Gate is the best warehouse around.
