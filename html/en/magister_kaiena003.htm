Magister Kaiena:
<br>
Ho ho ho, are you nuts? You don't know the difference between an Elf and a Dark Elf, a Human and an Orc, plus a Dwarf? Or do you not know the difference between a Fighter and a Mystic? Or don't you know how to read? Or can't you see 'Magister' written right here? If these are not it, are you trying to fool around with me?
<br>
I mean, my Master whines about a bad dream he had, golems rampage around and eye balls fly around, the Sea of Spores is expanding day by day, Mitraell is confined somewhere, I suffer from arduous tasks and plus the shine is shining brightly and some queer fellow comes up to and asks 'Will you teach me magic?'
<br>
Please leave me alone! And, this place has nothing to do with Clerics, if you are one go somewhere else.
