High Priest Orven:
<br>
That is the Feather of Gabrielle... In that case, it means you are wanting to get a mark of watcher from me so that you can go conquer Antharas. Do we really need to be sending out our innocent young people to the den of evil again...? What a waste. What a waste...
<br>
We've suffered so long under this endless death and malicious circle of destruction. And you say we've finally gotten the answer? The beginning of unhappiness is our evil actions. It is said that the gods sent the evil creatures to the land in order to punish the bad actions that had been committed by the beings they had created.
<br>
Do you know about it? I'm talking about the sin committed by our ancestors in order to appease the dragons? Before the aura was set up to confine Antharas, they sacrificed pure virgins to the land dragon every year. As if to make fun of our servile actions, Antharas used black sorcery to change the virgins that had been sacrificed into evil creatures called bloody queens. And until now, those wretched ones have cursed the Humans that sacrificed them.
<br>
If you want to go face to face with Antharas, you must first cleanse the sin of the selfish actions of our ancestors. If you go to the east of this village, you will find the area called the Seal of Shilen. And you must wipe out the <font color="LEVEL">bloody queens</font> that roam around that area. If you do that, the <font color="LEVEL">malignant spirits of sacrifice</font> will appear. Present them with the repose of death and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">remains of sacrificed</font>. With that, I will perform the repose of soul mass so that the souls of the virgins that were sacrificed can find eternal rest.
