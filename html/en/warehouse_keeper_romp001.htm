Warehouse Keeper Romp, in charge of cargo boxes:
<br>
Just because you are near Aden castle, if you let your guard down, you may lose your life.  Since this place is close to the border, you never know what kind of danger is lurking around you.  For this reason… we all recognize the importance of the existence of warehouses, don’t you agree?  If you have any precious items with you, make sure to store them in a warehouse.  Even when you Get! Killed!, your stuff will be safe with us.
