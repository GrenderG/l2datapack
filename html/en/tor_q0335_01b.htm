Hunters Guild Member Tor:
<br>
Everyday, we the hunters guild receive dozens of hunting requests!  People of all walks of life and backgrounds from a village matron who is seeking to recover an article left by her departed grandmother to some aristocrat who wants to excavate the treasures of ancient empires put in their requests to our guild.
<br>
Would you be also interested in taking on a request?
