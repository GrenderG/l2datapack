Hunter Guild Member Grey: This is the task of gathering
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">20 light-blue runestones</font>. For your reference, you can get these runestones by destroying <font color="LEVEL">manashen or enchanted stone golems</font> near the Ivory Tower area. So that outsiders cannot recklessly enter the tower, the mages of Ivory Tower appear to have planted runestones in the creatures of that area and are controlling them.
<br>
This is all I'm going to say on this matter. If you're a hunter, you've got to be able to gather the information yourself and find the items. Don't expect any more hints!
