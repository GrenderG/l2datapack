Trader Woodrow:
<br>
Thank you as always.  All the weapons sold in our store are genuine hand made items made by artisans.  We need high quality weapons like these because we are sharing a border with that heinous Elmore, and also we are located very near to the king!  However, be careful when you deal with other traders.  It seems like there are some unscrupulous traders that sell inferior weapons that have a similar appearance to real ones at an expensive priceâ€¦
