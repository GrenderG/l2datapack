Hierarch Asterios:
<br>
So, you have returned, my friend.... Yesâ€¦ You have brought the Water of Life. I am sorry that I didn't tell you the truth from the beginning. That we must kill Eva's unicorn which is the animal blessed by the Goddess, our guardian of the forest...  Please forgive me!!!
<br>
This Water of Life will be of great help in bringing life again to the Mother Tree. With the effort by many brothers and the sacrifice of a beautiful animal, I bet it will recover its health again, someday...
<br>
Now take this charm and go to <font color="LEVEL">Master Cardien of Dion Castle Town</font>. May the splendor of Mithril forever shine on the forest and lake!
