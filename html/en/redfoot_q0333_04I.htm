All right, let’s go ahead and open this box…  Opening a padlock like this one is a piece of cake…  Here we go!  There… that was too easy.  Now, let’s see what’s in the box.

Although I don’t know for sure, these seem to be parts that are used by dwarves to do repair work on golems.  If you take them to a store, I think you will be able to sell them at a pretty reasonable price.
