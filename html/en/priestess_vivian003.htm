Priestess Vyvyan:
<br>
The teachings of the god of light are abundant in the whole world. If you listen, you can hear them from the mountains and fields and the trees and insects. The god of light will communicate her message to you in spite of those that serve gods of different names and those warriors that carry around iron weapons. Go find a master and listen to his words. You'll find truth there...
