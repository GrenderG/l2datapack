Earthdragon Watcher Theodric:<br>…is this the fragment of the abyss jewel?  Quick.  Hand it over to me…   I will entrust it to the dwarves of the Gray Column guild so that followers of Antharas will not use it to cause havoc again.  Dwarves will melt this fragment of abyss jewel away completely in the “blast furnace of supremacy”…  <br>Now the time has come for you to confront Antharas.  I guess everybody must have tried to dissuade you by saying that you don’t have any chance of winning this fight, right?  However, the fact that you have come thus far is proof that you have made a firm resolution …  So, I won’t try to stop you.  Are you ready…?<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=337&reply=1">Tell him that you are ready.</a></body></html>
