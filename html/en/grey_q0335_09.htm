Hunter Guild Member Grey:<br>So you want to see the 2-circle hunter license test? OK, I think you're up to giving it a try. In the same way as before, in the 2-circle test you have to bring back at least three of the items written on the test list. Of course, these items will be more difficult to get than those of the 1-circle test. Why don't you take a look at the list first?<br><a action="link grey_q0335_10.htm">View list.</a></body></html>
