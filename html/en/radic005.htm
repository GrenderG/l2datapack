Warehouse Keeper Radic:<br>There is nothing under your name... Hmm, I have checked several times, but I can find nothing that belongs to you. Our warehouse is absolutely safe... Ah, come to think of it, places like the Forbidden Gateway and the Seal of Mitraell... Wonder why they did something troublesome like that. If they just deposited it at our Dwarven warehouses it would have been just as safe... <br>Huh? You still here? Anyway, I do not have anything with your name!</body></html>
