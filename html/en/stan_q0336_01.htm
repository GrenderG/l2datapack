Guard Stan:
<br>
I had my own reason to apply for the guard position.  While I stand here on my guard duty, I have the chance to meet with people from all over the world, and this gives me the opportunity to collect rare coins.  Heh heh heh
<br>
By the way, what would you like to trade with?  These are all the coins I haveâ€¦  Also if you would like to trade with me, you will need <font color="LEVEL">Blood Werewolf, Gold knight or Blood Medusa</font>. Make your choice from what I have.
