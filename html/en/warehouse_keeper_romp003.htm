Warehouse Keeper Romp, in charge of cargo boxes:
<br>
Ah!  I cannot take your stuff.  Although it is the motto of our warehouse to accept everyone’s cargo without discrimination.  You are an identified criminal who is wanted by the human kingdom.  In order to ensure the prosperity of our guild, we need to cooperate with humans…   Therefore, you will have to carry your own stuff whichever way you like…
