Hunter Guild Member Grey:
<br>
You've worked hard. I knew that you'd be able to complete the test without much trouble. You've now become a respectable 2-circle hunter. Congratulations!
<br>
From now on, you'll be able to take on hunting requests that are to be carried out only by 2-circle hunters. Go to Hunter Guild Member Tor.
<br>
Or how about visiting Cybellin? He says he still has requests to make and is looking for a hunter...
