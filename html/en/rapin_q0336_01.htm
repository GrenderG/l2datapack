Magic Trader Ralph:
<br>
Isn’t the power of magic great?  It turned this item into such a beautiful object.  Although I’m just a simple trader, I can’t help but bow my head to such a masterpiece...
<br>
By the way what would you like to trade for it?  All I have are these coins…  and, if you would like to trade with me, you will need <font color="LEVEL">Gold Drake, Silver Golem, and Silver Unicorn</font>. Take a look at my items and make a choice.
