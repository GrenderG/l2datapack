Earthdragon Watcher Gilmore:
<br>
...It is the  <font color="LEVEL">cave keepers and cave maidens</font> who are guarding the abyss jewel. By the use of sorcery, they made the jewel invisibleâ€¦   If you start to kill them off randomly one by one, the magic power hiding the jewel will get weakened and the jewel will start to materialize.
<br>
Destroy the jewel and take a fragment of the abyss jewel with you and go see <font color="LEVEL">Theodric who is an earchdragon watcher</font> like myself. Then he will hand you over a <font color="LEVEL">portal stone</font>. Theodric is standing guard at the entrance of the cave that leads to the Lair of Antharas located in the deepest part of Dragon Valley.
<br>
If you have fellow fighters, send them all to me.  They also need to fulfill a task and receive a portal stone before they can help you confront Antharas.
