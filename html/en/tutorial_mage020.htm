You have reached level 7!<br>As a Mystic, you may learn new skills from <font color="LEVEL">Sorcerers</font> when you reach level 7. The Sorcerers who teach you skills are marked in yellow, so go speak to them.<br>Remember, to learn skills you will need <font color="LEVEL">skill points (SP)</font>. You may check your skill points (SP) from your Status window (<font color="LEVEL">ALT+T</font>). If you do not have enough SP for the skill you want, obtain more by hunting.
