Unless your friends are rich and generous, I suppose you're still using the weapons and armor you were given by the guilds?
<br>
For now, whatever you have will do. After defeating monsters, you'll often find armor they left behind. Sometimes weapons, too. If you're lucky, you may get your hands on <font color="LEVEL">cloth shoes</font>, <font color="LEVEL">apprentice's shoes</font> or <font color="LEVEL">cloth caps</font> as hunting spoils.
<br>
Your guild will have issued you two weapons to start with: a dagger and a guild member's club. I hope you've figured out the difference. Ha! The <font color="LEVEL">dagger</font> is swift, and has a good chance to do critical damage, while a <font color="LEVEL">club (blunt)</font> is much slower, but is more likely to score a hit. Remember, the weapons you choose to carry will affect the skills you can get.
<br>
Come back when you reach <font color="LEVEL">Level 6</font>, and I'll tell you more about weapons.
