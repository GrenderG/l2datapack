Hunter Guild Member Grey: This is the task of gathering
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">40 scales of guardian basilisk</font>. For your reference, guardian basilisks mainly live in the <font color="LEVEL">Death Pass</font>.
<br>
I really shouldn't be giving you a hint like this... That's because gathering information about where and how to get the items is part of the test itself. You should be thankful for my special help this time only!
