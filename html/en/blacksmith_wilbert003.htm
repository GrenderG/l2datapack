Blacksmith Wilbert:<br>I can't just teach you something because you say you want to learn it. This is something on which the livelihood of us Dwarves depends. Not just that, but you don't even know the basics to learn it. The basics, I say! You've got to be at least a Dwarven Warsmith or Artisan before I can teach you the skill!</body></html>
