Gabrielle:<br>OK, then. Now go to the seal guardians active at each location and perform the tasks that they give you. The guardians do not show their true characters to just anyone but they are brothers who are joined in strong union and a clear sense of mission. If you show them this feather, they will know that you are someone who intends to join the conquest to conquer Antharas and will bestow on you suitable tests.<br>There are a total of four guardians that you must meet. <font color="LEVEL">The people you must meet are Sorcerer Kaena at the Ivory Tower</font>,<font color="LEVEL"> Captain Chakiras in Hunter Village </font>and <font color="LEVEL">Master Kendra</font> and <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Orben of Aden Castle Village</font>. If you complete the tasks that they give you and bring the <font color="LEVEL">marks of watcher</font>, I'll teach you the way to enter inside the aura that surrounds the Lair of Antharas.<br>I'm warning you; the tasks will not be easy. Please carry out the trials together with your comrades that you can live and die with. If they are compatriates whom you can entrust with your very own life, tell them to come visit me. I will also give them this challenge and my feather mark.<br>Keep this in mind. Even the great ones of old couldn't do anything on their own. When they fought together, they were able to achieve great things. OK, may the divine protection of Einhasad be with you...<br><a action="link gabrielle_q0337_06a.htm">Ask about guardians.</a></body></html>
