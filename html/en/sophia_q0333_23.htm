Mercenary Sophia:
<br>
Dear brother.  I appreciate your hard work in carrying out the mission.  I’ll give you your reward according to the number of proofs you have brought back.
<br>
What is that box…?  It seems like you have brought back a cargo box that belongs to a traders union.  Since there is no clause regarding the returning of a cargo box written in our contract, I guess we don’t have the duty to return the cargo to the traders.  But, if we return it to the traders’ union, perhaps they will give us some sort of reward?  If you don’t feel like helping traders, you can go see Red Foot.  He is an expert in dealing with spoils that are hard to get rid of.
