Sorcerer Kaiena:
<br>
Are you people that have come after talking to Gabrielle...? Well, I won't waste your time with a long explanation. Just go to the <font color="LEVEL">Flaming Marsh</font> and kill <font color="LEVEL">marsh stalkers and marsh drakes</font>.  If you can't do that, not only would you not be able to face Antharas, you'd become a cool corpse after just meeting the guardians of Antharas that guard the entrance to Dragon Valley. Please notify this also to your compatriots that have the same intentions. Tell them to meet me and take on this task. If not, they'll never be qualified to join the conquering expedition with you.
