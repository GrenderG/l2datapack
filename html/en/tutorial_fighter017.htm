You have reached level 5!<br>Fighters may learn new skills from <font color="LEVEL">Masters</font> at level 5. The Masters who teach skills are marked in yellow, so visit them.<br>In order to learn skills, <font color="LEVEL">skill points (SP)</font> are be needed. You may check your skill points (SP) from your Character Status window <font color="LEVEL">(ALT+T).</font> If you do not have enough SP for the skill you want, earn more by hunting. Your SP and experience increase as you successfully hunt.<br>But remember one more thing -- from now on you will receive an <font color="LEVEL">experience penalty</font> when you are killed; you will lose experience each time you die.<br><a action="link tutorial_close_0">Close Window</a></body></html>
