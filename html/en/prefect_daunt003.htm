Prefect Daunt:<br>I envy your courage, I'll tell you something, We noble Orcs walk the path of military arts since we are very young and we have to overcome many asceticisms, people like you who try to obtain our arts might die.<br>May you continue on the path you were walking. That path will also be worth it, I totally respect you.</body></html>
