Warehouse Keeper Wilfred:
<br>
Welcome, young friend! So, you are taking an exam to promote to a higher member of the union? I took the same exam long time ago. Of course now I can't remember what it was all about, ha ha ha! Yesâ€¦ So Parman told you to ask me about the Mark of Health?
<br>
Speaking of it, I remember talking with Parman before about a similar subject... My memories are fainting away... What did I tell him...
