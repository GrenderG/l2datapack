Master Kendra:<br>Come on in. I trust the eye of Gabrielle but still I'd like to give you a test myself too. I mean, I don't want innocent youngsters to die a dog's death. If you want to receive mark of watcher from me, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of Mirrors</font> and kill <font color="LEVEL">harit lizardman chiefs and harit lizardman shamans</font> and bring me the evidence of having done so.  They aren't comparable to Antharas but those guys are still not exactly easy opponents. It would be best to gather some of your buddies and go fight together.</body></html>
