Wharf Manager Felton:

You look familiar for some reason…  Yes, I’m pretty sure I saw you somewhere.  Hold on a second…  Let me check on something…

Oh ho!  You are an identified criminal who is wanted for a murder charge!  No, no, no!  I cannot sell you a ticket no matter what.  If I put someone like you on the boat, I might be putting our passengers’ lives in jeopardy!
