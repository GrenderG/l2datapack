Mercenary Red Foot:

All right, let’s go ahead and open this box…  Opening a padlock like this one is a piece of cake…  Here we go!  There… that was too easy.  Now, let’s see what’s in the box.
<br>
Isn’t this a dress?!  This is a silk dress for a woman.  It looks pretty expensive, don’t you think?  Take a look at this design.  This is an item that has been imported from Avella of the East.  At a time like this, who would use such a luxurious item…?  This must be ordered by a noblewoman who has a liking for foreign products… don’t you think?  You should take this to a store and sell it off!  I’m sure you will get a very high price for it.
