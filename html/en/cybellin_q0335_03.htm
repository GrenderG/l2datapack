Good. I have written down on this order form the work that you need to do for me. But I'll save you some time and explain the process too...
<br>
First, take this jewel and dagger. The jewel is a <font color="LEVEL">blood crystal</font> that I've been researching about recently. The crystal's purity is currently at level 1. What you need to do is raise the purity of the crystal. And doing so is quite simple. If you kill evil things with the dagger I have given you, the blood crystal will absorb the blood of the creatures. At that time and according to a certain probability, the crystal will either increase in purity or be destroyed.
<br>
If you raise the purity of the crystal and bring it to me, I'll give you a reward. Of course, the higher the purity, the more of a reward I can give you. But it is risky since there is a chance each time that the crystal will break.
<br>
The evil beings that you must kill with the dagger in order to raise the purity are <font color="LEVEL">leto lizardmen</font> and <font color="LEVEL">harit lizardmen</font>. And I wouldn't know why the blood crystal reacts with the lizardman blood but... Maybe it's because the theory is right that lizards are of the bloodline of dragons. Also, even among lizardmen, certain grades of blood are useful and some grades have no effect at all on the blood crystal. It's just something you'll have to figure out by trial and error...
