Warehouse Keeper Walderal:
<br>
When you are running a warehouse, whether you like it or not, you get to know all sorts of odd secrets.  For example, a few days ago, some high level official whose name I cannot reveal placed with us a very cute needlework doll… The doll was very well made… but it seemed like it wasn’t worth the storage fee we charge.  What do you think this means?  Heh heh heh…
