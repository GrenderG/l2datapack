Warehouse Keeper Romp, in charge of cargo boxes:
<br>
You can trust us the Iron Gate Guild more than you can trust your wife’s faithfulness.  We never open our gate to anyone other than those with proper permission.  So don’t worry and have a safe trip and come back.  In the very unlikely occasion, if any of your warehoused items becomes damaged, I swear that I will shave off my beard completely!
