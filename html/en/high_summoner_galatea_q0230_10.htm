High Summoner Galatea:
<br>
As I previously stated, in order to pass the Trial of the Summoner, you must <font color="LEVEL">battle and defeat 6 Summoners</font>. Before you leave for battle you must have your own unique <font color="LEVEL">Arcana Cards</font> created. Go and ask <font color="LEVEL">Lars of the Town of Dion</font>.
<br>
Do you have any other questions?
