Are you applying for the 2-circle hunter license test already? Whew... You're really ambitious. But, look here. It's still too much for you. I recognize your ability but you still need more important practical experience. For the time being, it would be best if you develop your talents while carrying out hunting requests.

(You can apply for the 2-circle license test after reaching level 45.)
