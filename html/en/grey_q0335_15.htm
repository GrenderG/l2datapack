Hunter Guild Member Grey:<br>You said you're going to leave the guild? Is that something you can do just because you want to? This is an organization where, once you've set foot inside, you can never leave... Didn't you know that?... Why don't you think about it again?... OK?<br>... Oh, your serious expression is just hilarious! It's a joke, OK? A joke! I was just saying that because you said that you wanted to leave the guild. Well, I'm sure you've got your own reasons... There's nothing I can do about it if you are sure you want to quit.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=335&reply=3">Leave</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=335&reply=4">Cancel</a></body></html>
