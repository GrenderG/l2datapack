Gabrielle:
<br>
When the evil beings of Shilen fought against the gods of the heavens in ancient times, Antharas was injured greatly and came down to what is now the Giran region to hide his body in the middle of the valley. Then Antharas fell into a deep sleep, waiting for his injury to heal over thousands of years. The seal guaradians got help from Great Sorcerer Dasparion to create a strong aura that restricts the power of Antharas who is sleeping. As a result, this has functioned as a strong wall to block evil ones from entering into the Lair of Antharas but the more important thing is that it has the power to keep Antharas from waking from his deep sleep.
<br>
For the last several hundred years, the seal guardians have watched this aura and have prevented unauthorized people from entering inside. If you wish to participate in the expedition to conquer Antharas, you must pass the severe test of the guardians. This test will be a very difficult trial that will put your life on the line. But if you are unable to get through this trial successfully, you'll never be able to have victory against the land dragon.
