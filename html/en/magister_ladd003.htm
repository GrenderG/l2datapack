Magister Ladd:
<br>
Ha ha ha, you are as dumb as you look. Mages can only learn magic, from a Magister of his own race, I'm telling you this because I think you don't know about it. Elves or Humans downstairs, Dwarves or Orcs, and the rest of the Fighters... I don't care.

Oh, and if you are a Cleric it will be best for you to visit the temple.
