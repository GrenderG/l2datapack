Warehouse Keeper Radic:<br>Greetings, adventurer. Welcome to the Ivory Tower. I was going to ask you to first deposit your property and to have a tour...but you don't seem like a normal traveler. A traveler with wicked characteristics. I wish to call you a lunatic like Beleth or Hardin, but it seems like you are not as prominent as they are. Get lost!</body></html>
