Hmm… when we buy items, roughly we pay about 50% less than their retail price.  No…, it’s a little less than that.  That’s why it seems like many people choose to do direct exchange of items to purchase items they need.  But, that is not very convenient.  If the item you’re selling is inexpensive, it would be easier for you to sell it to a store directly.
