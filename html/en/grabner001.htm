Weapons Trader Graham:
<br>
Come in, come in. Welcome to our famous and historical store. Weâ€™ve got many types of rare weapons, from might arms made by Dwarven craftsmen to mithril weapons imbued with the mysterious powers of the Elves. Take your time to look around, and just call me if you need anything. By the way, there are vicious monsters surrounding these parts, so you should equip yourself well before leaving the town.
