Gabrielle:
<br>
May the blessings of Einhasad be with you! Thanks to you, the plot of the group that serves Antharas could be prevented. Unfortunately, we were not able to ascertain their true identities but for the time being, they will not threaten the aura again.
<br>
I hereby give you herald of slayer. Thus, I bestow on you the destiny of opposing Antharas who is called the tyrant of the land and disaster of Giran. May the divine protection of the gods...
<br>
It is now time for the expedition to conquer Antharas to leave. Go to the entrance to Dragon Valley and meet Land Dragon Watcher Gilmore. Don't be surprised by his wicked appearance. He was one of the 17 guardians that participated in the sealing of Antharas. He chose to become an undead in order to faithfully carry out his role. He will teach you how to enter the Lair of Antharas.
