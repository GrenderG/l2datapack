Gabrielle:<br>I am one of the seal guardians. We are the ones that are watching the seal put in place by Emperor of Light Shunaiman in order to restrain the evil creatures derived from Shilen and to be sure that the force isn't broken or damaged. Just a bit ago, we had a meeting to discuss a very grave matter. The reason for this is that now, the dragon, who is the most fearsome of the evil creatures and is called the tyrant of the land and disaster of Giran, has awoken from his deep sleep. We guardians are watching Antharas who may explode out of his lair at any time and we have decided to attack him first. So we are recruiting an expedition to conquer Antharas. <br><a action="link gabrielle_q0337_01a.htm">Say that you want to participate in the conquering expedition.</a></body></html>
