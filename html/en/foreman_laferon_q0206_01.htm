It's always a pleasure to meet a young Dwarf like you. Work hard and you'll become a great Dwarf in time. Don't waste your efforts like those Humans do, but devote your energy to the pursuit of profit. That's the Dwarvish way.
<br>
Here's some free advice for you. Visit <font color="LEVEL">Guide Gullin</font> in the village. He'll tell you more about what it means to be a true Dwarf. The Dwarven Village is to the northwest.
<br>
It will be easy to find Gullin; he shows up as a yellow dot on your radar.
