Grand Sorcerer Gallint:
<br>
Good job. Now you are ready to begin your adventures.
<br>
Go to the village. <font color="LEVEL">Guide Lancelot</font> is waiting for you there. Go and seek him out. He will teach you the arts you need to survive in these lands.
<br>
To get to the village, go west and then north from the School of Wizardry. It will be easy to find Lancelot, for he is marked with a yellow dot in your radar.
