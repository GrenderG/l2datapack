Warehouse Chief Gesto:<br>I am Warehouse Chief Gesto of the Iron Gate, here in Gludio. Our Iron Gate Guild’s motto is to 'sell anything to any race if it is needed.' We are not hindered by the snowy fields, deserts, or volcanic regions. We are a magnificent guild that operates in all parts of the world, increasing the economic prosperity of the Dwarven race. Ha ha ha, aren’t we magnificent?<br>But you seem like a new face. Have we met before? Anyway, why have you come to me?<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-2&reply=1">Hear information on 2nd occupational change.</a><br><a action="link pl001.htm">Clan</a><br><a action="link al001.htm">Alliance</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
