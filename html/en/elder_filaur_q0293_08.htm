This should be enough.<br>Let me see ... Hmm ... Oh. Stupid Orcs, their map is too hard to read. But I can still roughly figure out the location. My investigators will have no problem locating the vein.<br>As I said before, there are many hidden veins. Continue to find more maps! I will reward you whenever you bring new maps, so don't worry about that.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=293&reply=1">Say you will quit</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=293&reply=2">Say you will continue</a></body></html>
