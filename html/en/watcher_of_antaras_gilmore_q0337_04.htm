Earthdragon Watcher Gilmore:
<br>
… Now, the strong power of darkness is being felt in the valley…  Unless you destroy the <font color="LEVEL">abyss jewel</font> quickly, Antharas will be awakened before you even enter the lair of the earthdragon.  You should hurry.  Kill the <font color="LEVEL">cave keepers and cave maidens</font> and destroy the abyss jewel.  Then take the fragment of abyss jewel and go see the <font color="LEVEL">earthdragon watcher Theodric</font>. He is standing guard at the entrance of the cave that leads to the Lair of Antharas located in the deepest part of Dragon Valley.
