Hunter Guild Member Grey:
<br>
Many young people want to join our guild. It looks like you think that by joining our guild you'll be able to cut through the evil, explore ruins and enjoy romantic adventures.
<br>
But becoming a hunter is not so easy like that. Because only excellent people that are suitable for the reputation of the Hunter Guild are chosen, a hunter license is only given to those that complete a severe test.
<br>
Young people without a plan that come to this village and say they will become hunters often pack their bags and leave before even a week has passed. Are you also one of those beginners?
<br>
