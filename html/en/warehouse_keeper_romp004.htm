Warehouse Keeper Romp, in charge of cargo boxes:
<br>
Dwarven fighter, Raider, Master Raider, Dwarven fighter, Raider, Master Raider, Dwarven fighter, Raidâ€¦  Huh?
<br>
You, how long have you been here?  Hey!  You are not a Dwarven fighter, Raider, or Master Raider, right?  Then, I cannot teach you.  I can only teach Dwarven fighters,  Raiders, or Master Raiders.  Understand?
