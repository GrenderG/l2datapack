A Mercenary can be said to be a specialized Rogue. That is why the combat style and party play is similar to a Rogue using a dagger. During certain times in a Siege Battle, Mercenarys can play the role of an Assassin. When an opponent appears he can instantly increase evasion and movement, enabling himself to follow his opponent to kill.
