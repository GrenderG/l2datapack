Sorcerer Dieter:
<br>
You who search for the truth of magic, welcome. I perceive a strong passion for knowledge in your eyes... Yes, one must truly desire learning in order to become a potent Mystic.
<br>
However, there are those who become blinded by their greed for knowledge, who begin studying forbidden magic. Excessive curiosity can lead to destruction. You must be careful to bridle your passion!
<br>
Well then, shall we begin the lesson?
