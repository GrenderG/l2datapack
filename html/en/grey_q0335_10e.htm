Hunter Guild Member Grey: This is the task of gathering
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">20 imperial arrowheads</font>. This is also not a particularly difficult task. It is said that if you go to the <font color="LEVEL">National Cemetary</font> and kill the undead archers, you can get the arrowheads made during the time of the ancient Elmoreden Empire. So, what do you think? Not very difficult, no?
