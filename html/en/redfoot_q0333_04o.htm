Mercenary Red Foot:
<br>
All right, let’s go ahead and open this box…  Opening a padlock like this one is a piece of cake…  Here we go!  There… that was too easy.  Now, let’s see what’s in the box.
<br>
What’s this…?  A broken tablet fragment?  Hmm…  It has some incomprehensible symbols on it.  Is this a relic from ancient times?  If it was not a fragment but a complete tablet, this might have been a very valuable historical object.  If you can find all the fragments of the tablet, you can get them to be restored to its complete form…  If you are interested, go see <font color="LEVEL">Rupio</font> the blacksmith.  He is an expert of relic restoration.
