The Blessed Spiritshot - S Grade is used in conjunction with another S Grade weapon.  It is a support type magic item that greatly increases a weapon's M. Atk.
<br>
Also, this item is even more useful due to the fact that it has the effect of increasing one’s magic casting speed.
<br>
Since many wizards use the spiritshot to cast more powerful magic, the manufacture of a spiritshot will be of great benefit to Dwarves.
