Blacksmith Helton:
<br>
Oh, you're someone sent by Gabrielle. OK... You finally came.
<br>
I currently belong to the Black Anvil Guild but I have been trained as a seal guardian under Elder Filaur of the Gray Column Guild. I don't know if you know this, but recently there was a decisive battle between the brave warriors and the succubus gang that is trying to break the aura that restrains the "earthworm" underground in the Spine Mine region. One of our collaborators Tuwang Raldo used his hand quickly to hold up that column but the group that serves Antharas wasn't defeated and is setting up a new plan.
<br>
This time they are said to be using an <font color="LEVEL">abyss jewel</font> to destroy that aura set up in Dragon Valley.
