If an Overlord is a Shaman who specializes in blood pledge wars, a Warcrier specializes in party play. A Warcrier uses a spell called Song of War to heal, increase the fighting spirit and the abilities of our forces, and, on the other hand he curses the opponents to disrupt them.
<br>
Of course they have offensive magic skills, increasing attack speed, evasion, critical attack power by party members, and they have skills that will decrease the ability of the opponents.
<br>
To be a Warcrier, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Glory, and the Mark of the War Spirit.
