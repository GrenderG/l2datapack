Gatekeeper Minevea:<br>Hardin's Academy is not a place to visit just because you're curious. Do you know what kind of people necromancers are? To them, the blood, body, bones and skin of people are nothing more than ingredients for their magic... They are ones that can give you an even crueler death than Dark Elves... That's the kind of people you'll find in here.<br>Are you afraid? If you want to get out of here quickly, I'll open the Gate of Space and Time for you to leave. You can go as far as you want instantaneously.<br><a action="bypass -h teleport_request">Go to another village.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
