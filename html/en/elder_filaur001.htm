Elder Filaur:
<br>
May the blessing of the rich earth be with you. Welcome to the House of Elders, my dear young Dwarf. I, Filaur, am the representative of the glorious <font color="LEVEL">Gray Column Guild</font>. I am a member of the Senior Guild Association, who rule the kingdom in the name of the <font color="LEVEL">King of Dwarves</font>, who will return someday.
