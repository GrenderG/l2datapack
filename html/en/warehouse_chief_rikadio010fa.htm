Warehouse Chief Rikadio:
<br>
To become a Raider, you must be at least level 20 and must pass the Test of the Raider.
<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not yet passed the Test of the Raider. Ask <font color="LEVEL">Collector Pippi of the Dwarven village</font> about the test. She will tell you everything you need to know about it in detail. After you have passed the test, come to me. Then I will change your profession to a Raider.
