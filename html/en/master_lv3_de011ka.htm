Congratulations! At last, you have become a Shilien Knight of the proud Dark Elves. The life of a Shilien Knight may still feel strange but you do not need to worry. Everything is going to be all right once you start learning from the Masters around you.
<br>
In the future, I hope you become a proud Dark Elf with high dignity who glorifies the name of Shilen and magnificently destroys the arrogant Elves. Congratulations again on becoming a Shilien Knight!
