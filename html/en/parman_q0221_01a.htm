Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br>You, shouldn't you start preparing to be an upper level member of the union? How about a Master Raider or a Warsmith?<br>What do you say to that? Does that interest you? Keep this in mind. In order to be an upper level member, you must pass the <font color="LEVEL">Test of Prosperity</font>. It is no match to the member's trial. You are too unexperienced to take this test. First of all, I think you should exceed your level as a apprentice and move up to a higher position. When you promote from your current level as a Dwarven character thencome back to me.<br>(Quest only for Dwarven characters who have completed occupation change and of have level 37 or above.)</body></html>
