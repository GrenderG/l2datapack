Warehouse Chief Moke:
<br>
An abyss jewel is a device used to make the power of dark magic flow to only one place.  The followers of Antharas are working on concentrating the magic power of darkness so that they can break down the magic force field.  When the magic force field is dissolved and Antharas is awakened completely, that will be the end of us all.  There will no longer be a tomorrow for us!  So, we have to destroy the abyss jewel as soon as possible!
<br>
The abyss jewel is currently located in the <font color="LEVEL">northwestern shore of Gludio</font>. Please go there quickly with your fellow fighters and break the jewel to pieces.  But be careful.  The spirits of darkness guarding the abyss jewel will attack you and try to stop you.  You should kill them off without leaving anyone alive.  Although you destroy the jewel, if there is any surviving spirit of darkness left, it can create a new abyss jewel by using a small fragment of the abyss jewel.
<br>
Now you know what you need to do, donâ€™t you?  Bring back a <font color="LEVEL">fragment of the abyss jewel</font> and <font color="LEVEL">and the proof that you have slain a jewel guardian</font>. If you can bring back these two, I will give you a mark of watchers.
