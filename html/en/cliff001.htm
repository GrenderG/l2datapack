Warehouse Freightman Cliff:
<br>
Oh, welcome , welcome. Heavy eh? Put down your stuff...
<br>
This place is managed by the Dwarven bank union. Once you have deposited your items, I can give you total assurance that they'll stay safe. I mean, in all of history have you ever heard of a warehouse, managed by a Dwarf, being robbed? I bet you haven't.
