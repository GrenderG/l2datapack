Go through the list and see if you can find a request you would like to work on.  For your information, all the requests are divided into 3 classes according to their degree of difficulty and size of reward.  Class C is the most common class that has moderate difficulty and comes with an average reward.  Class B is a little more difficult but its reward is better.   We receive a Class A case only rarely, and while it is very difficult to accomplish, its reward is the best.
