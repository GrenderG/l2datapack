Operates the trap function that is inside the castle. If you operate this function, fire of magic will come out from the trap device and slow down the movements of those going above it while setting fire to their bodies.

Of course, this effect is also applied to allies so you should take adequate care regarding it... I would say there is no other device more useful in the castle defense.
<br>
Of course, it costs a lot to operate this trap, too.
