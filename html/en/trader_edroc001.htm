Trader Edroc:<br>Excuse me, is this your first time at the Hunters' Village? If so, let me explain briefly about the village. Listen up...<br>Actually this village was first formed by Hunters who gathered here to hunt mysterious creatures. These creatures are not just mysterious but also hard to catch. That is why, even if we call them 'Hunters' they are very different from the ones which hunt rabbits. Anyway, the Hunters here have the guts to stand off with the royal people.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=0">Buy Fighters' equipment</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=1">Buy Mages' equipment</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=8">Sell</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
