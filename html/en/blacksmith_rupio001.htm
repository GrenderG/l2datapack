Blacksmith Rupio:<br>So nice to see you, young traveler. I am Rupio, dispatched from the Black Anvil.<br>My brother Pushkin and I wish to make the best forge in Giran. We couldn't work for a while because our tools hadn't yet arrived from the Dwarven Village in the north. Finally they're here and we can begin our work.<br><a action="link dual_sword001.htm">Create Double-blade</a><br><a action="link blacksmith_recipe.htm">Create Item</a><br><a action="bypass -h learn_skill">Learn Skills</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
