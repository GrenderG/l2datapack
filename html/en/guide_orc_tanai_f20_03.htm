At your level, you can hunt anywhere on the Immortal Plateau. You should go to the far eastern edge of the plateau, and attempt the Cave of Ordeal. From ancient times, powerful Orc Fighters have used the cave to prove their power. You can hunt kasha bears and Baranka's followers in the region around the cave.
