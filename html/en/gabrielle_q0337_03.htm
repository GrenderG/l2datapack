Gabrielle:<br>Oh... You are really brave. But Antharas is a stronger creature than any you've gone up against until now. Dragons... They are creatures with such fearful power that they aren't even afraid of the gods. When the brave ones of the ancient empire went up against such incredible strength, many of them lost their lives. I'm not sure if you have the strength to back up your bravery...<br>If those of unproven ability enter the Lair of Antharas they may end up simply completely awakening him and causing him to break out from his lair. If you really want to be a member of the conquering expedition, you must complete the task given by us guardians and prove that you've got the strength to face off against Antharas. If you do that, you'll become qualified to enter into the aura that protects the Lair of Antharas.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=337&reply=2">Ask about the aura.</a></body></html>
